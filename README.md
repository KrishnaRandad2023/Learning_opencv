### Lesson 1: Image Loading, Resizing, Rotating, etc.
This lesson covers:
- Loading an image
- Resizing and rotating images
- Saving an image after manipulation

[Code and Examples](./lesson1-image%20loading%20,%20resize,%20rotate,etc)

### Lesson 2: Image Fundamentals and Manipulation
This lesson explores:
- Understanding image properties (shape, size, color channels)
- Manipulating pixel values
- Grayscale and color transformations

[Code and Examples](./lesson2-image%20fundamentals%20and%20manip)

### Lesson 3: Camera and Video Capture
In this lesson, we:
- Capture video from a camera
- Save video streams
- Perform basic video manipulations

[Code and Examples](./lesson3-camera%20and%20videocapture)

### Lesson 4: Drawing on Images
Here, we learn how to:
- Draw shapes (rectangles, circles, lines) on images
- Add text to an image

[Code and Examples](./lesson4-drawing)

### Lesson 5: Color and Color Detection
In this lesson, we:
- Work with color spaces (RGB, HSV, etc.)
- Detect specific colors in an image

[Code and Examples](./lesson5-color%20and%20color%20detection)

### Lesson 6: Corner Detection
This lesson covers:
- Understanding corner detection algorithms (e.g., Harris Corner Detection)
- Implementing corner detection in OpenCV

[Code and Examples](./lesson6-corner%20detection)

### Lesson 7: Object Detection
Here, we:
- Explore basic object detection techniques
- Work with Haar Cascades and other object detection methods

[Code and Examples](./lesson7-object%20detection)

### Lesson 8: Face and Eye Detection
In this lesson, we:
- Detect faces and eyes in images using Haar Cascades

[Code and Examples](./lesson7-face%20and%20eye%20detection)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)

To install OpenCV, run:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
